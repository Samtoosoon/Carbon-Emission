# 🌍 Carbon Footprint Prediction Project

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for building a regression model to predict carbon footprint based on given features. The project aims to demonstrate the implementation of machine learning techniques in environmental impact assessment.

## 📋 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (>=2.0)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (optional for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for interactive development)

## 🚀 Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/carbon-footprint-prediction.git
   cd carbon-footprint-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the regression model:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook carbon_footprint_prediction.ipynb
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python carbon_footprint_prediction.py
   ```

4. Experiment with hyperparameters, model architecture, and feature engineering to improve model performance.

## 📁 File Structure
- `carbon_footprint_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for model development, training, and evaluation.
- `carbon_footprint_prediction.py`: Python script version of the regression model.
- `data/`: Directory containing sample or provided dataset for carbon footprint prediction.
- `README.md`: Project documentation and instructions.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.

## 📊 Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score on a test dataset. Continuous improvement and fine-tuning of the model parameters are encouraged to achieve better predictions.
